long_send.py
============

OK. So, provided the firewall allows port 5672, reaching across the
ether is as simple as adding a host parameter to the connection. On
the **source** machine:

    import amqp
    connection = amqp.Connection(host="destination.domain.tld")
    channel = connection.channel()
    channel.queue_declare(queue="hello")
    msg = amqp.Message(body="Hello World!")
    channel.basic_publish(msg, exchange="", routing_key="hello")
    print " [X] Sent 'Hello World!'"
    connection.close()

long_receive.py
===============

Meanwhile, on the receiving end (the **destination** machine), the
initial misconception was that I would need a bi-directional
connection. However, since ``long_send.py`` is dropping messages into
the remote queue on the destination computer, and ``long_receive.py``
lives on the destination computer, it is, in fact identical to
``receive.py`` in the previous "chapter": It is receiving from its
own local queue.
