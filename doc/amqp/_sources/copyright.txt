Did you notice the FREEDOMS we've granted you?
==============================================

This copyright license if **different!** It grants freedoms rather
than just imposing restrictions like most of the other textbooks you
probably have used.

* I know people copy textbooks illegally but I would LOVE it if you
  copied mine - go ahead copy to your hearts content, legally!

* Publishers revenue is generated by controlling the market, I don't
  want any money, go ahead, distribute my books far and wide - I
  DARE you!

* Ever wanted to change your textbook? Of course you have! Go ahead
  change mine, make your own version, get your friends together, rip
  it apart and put it back together the way you like it. That's what
  I really want!

* Copy, modify, adapt, enhance, share, critique, adore, and
  contextualise. Do it all, do it with your colleagues, your friends
  or alone but get involved!  Together we can overcome the challenges
  our complex and diverse country presents.

* So what is the catch? The only thing you can't do is take this book,
  make a few changes and then tell others that they can't do the same
  with your changes. It's share and share-alike and I know you'll
  agree that is only fair.

* This book was written by volunteers who want to help support
  education, who want the facts to be freely available for teachers to
  copy, adapt and re-use. Many hours went into making them and they
  are a gift to everyone in the education community.
